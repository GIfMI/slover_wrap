## Overview
slover_wrap is a wrapper code around the slice_overlay (slover) tool from Matthew Brett which is can be found on the [MRC CBU Wiki page](https://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/DisplaySlices) or on the [SPM repository on Github](https://github.com/spm/spm12/tree/master/%40slover).

## Getting started
